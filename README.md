# Joke_recommender
This project implements a joke recommendation system that suggests jokes based on user preferences. The system uses the PyJokes library to fetch jokes and applies basic Machine Learning techniques to personalize the recommendations. It analyzes user input or previous preferences to tailor the jokes, making the experience more engaging and fun. The system can be easily extended to include more sophisticated recommendation algorithms or integrate with other data sources to enhance joke selection.
